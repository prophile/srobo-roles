=====

The judging position involves the responsibility for ruling on
matters involving the game and the rules, managing the matches, and
providing commentary.

Responsibilities
----------------

* To ensure there is at least one judge at the judge's desk during
  matches,
* To make final decisions on interpretation of the rules,
* To record the scores from matches,
* To resolve disputes under advice from the linesmen,
* To provide commentary during matches,
* To alter the match schedule as necessary.

Shifts
------

There will be typically be one head judge and one other person
acting as an assistant judge during match periods. The head judge
will be one individual during the entire competition -- although,
unlike the head warden and safety officer roles, they are entirely
at liberty to leave their post -- and the assistant judge will sit
for 1 hour shifts.

Procedures
----------

At the each of match:

* The linesmen will hand completed match score forms to the Judge's Desk.
* These data should be transferred into compd.

Preparation
-----------

Blueshirts taking judging positions should be so utterly familiar
with [the rules](https://www.studentrobotics.org/docs/rules) that
others begin to question their sanity. They should also familiarise
themselves with the radio procedures.
