In case of emergency, one role in each area is the warden. The
warden must not leave that area unless no competitors or guests are
present, or they have been instructed to do so by on-site security.

Responsibilities

* To monitor their assigned area,
* To deal with any injuries or accidents that occur, even if such
  dealing is merely calling in others,
* To evacuate their area of competitors, guests and non-essential
  Blueshirts in case an evacuation of the area or building is
  necessary,
* To inform other Blueshirts about any incidents that occur over
  the radio link,
* To ensure the building alarm is raised in case of fire.

Shifts

For the areas containing Helpdesk and the Arena, the warden role
will typically be assigned to the permanent staffer on Helpdesk and
the Judge respectively. For other areas, the role will be held in
1-hour shifts.
