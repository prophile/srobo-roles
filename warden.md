Warden
======

In case of emergency, one role in each area is the warden. The
warden must not leave that area unless no competitors or guests are
present, or they have been instructed to do so by on-site security.

Responsibilities
----------------

* To monitor their assigned area,
* To deal with any injuries or accidents that occur, even if such
  dealing is merely calling in others,
* To enforce boundaries on team pits within their area, if any,
* To evacuate their area of competitors, guests and non-essential
  Blueshirts in case a general evacuation is ordered,
* To perform an area evacuation of their designated area should
  they deem it appropriate,
* To inform other Blueshirts about any incidents that occur over
  the radio link,
* For the warden of the arena area only, to manage teams' usage of
  the arena during tinker time,
* To keep the fire routes in their area clear,
* To ensure the building alarm is raised in case of fire.

Shifts
------

The role will be assigned in 90 minute shifts, plus 5 minutes either
side of transfer time.

Procedures
----------

If the warden deems it appropriate to evacuate the *area*, the
following procedure should be followed.

* Decide upon where to evacuate to, which may be an adjacent area,
  outside, or otherwise. Stairs should generally be avoided unless
  absolutely necessary.
* Announce the evacuation. A reason need not be publicly announced.
* Shepherd all non-essential Blueshirts, guests, competitors, and
  team leaders out to the chosen destination.
* Advise Blueshirts on the situation over the radio.
* Advise Blueshirts over the radio once the area is safe, which
  will then be broadcast over the PA system.

If a general evacuation order is given, the following procedure
must be followed.

* If the order is a radio instruction from the Head Warden or Safety
  Officer, acknowledge it.
* Announce the evacuation. The reason need not be publicly announced.
* Shepherd all non-essential Blueshirts, guest, competitors and
  team leaders to the designated assembly point. Do not leave the
  area until they have left. It is advised to instruct Blueshirts
  in your area on the situation so that they can assist.

In case of minor injuries:

* Direct the unfortunate recipient of the injury to an appropriate
  first aid point, to be accompanied by either a Blueshirt or their
  team leader.
* Inform other Blueshirts over the radio system of what has happened.

In case of significant injuries:

* Clear the immediate area.
* Summon the Safety Officer via the radio system.

Boundary enforcement:

* Teams are entitled to their full pit space, and have a responsibility
  not to spread into others' space.
* Should they do so, a gentle reminder of this fact should typically
  suffice.
* The fire routes should be kept clear, and teams should be reminded
  of this should they attempt to spread into them.

Preparation
-----------

Blueshirts doing shifts of assignation as area wardens should
familiarise themselves with:

* The building's fire evacuation plan,
* The main evacuation plan,
* The nearest fire alarm trigger points,
* The radio procedures,
* The usage of the powder fire extinguishers.
