Injuries
========

From time to happen, injuries do occur, even with events with the
level of sheer paranoia Student Robotics prides itself in exhibiting.

First Aid
---------

For minor injuries, first aid kits are available at the following
locations:

* Reception desk,
* Judge's desk,
* SUSU reception.

Using our own facilities at reception and the Judge's desk should
be preferred for minor cases, in order not to unnecessarily bother
the venue staff.

The relevant area warden should be informed on any injuries, who
will relay this information to the Safety Officer.

The SUSU have incident report forms which should be filled out,
even for minor injuries.

Major Injuries
--------------

In case of major injury:

* If the major injury takes place in or around the arena, matches
  must immediately be stopped and robots turned off. The *kill
  buttons* are provided for this purpose.
* For competitors, their team leader must be found and brought as
  soon as possible.
* The Head Warden and Safety Officer must be summoned, and they
  will take decisions about what actions need to be taken.

Teams without Team Leaders
--------------------------

Unfortunately, some teams may come without team leaders or responsible
adults. As much as this should be discouraged, it is something we
have to deal with when it arises.

For such teams:

* An individual safety briefing will be held,
* They must not use power tools unsupervised.

Wardens in areas with unsupervised team bays are advised, informally,
to keep a watchful eye on them.
