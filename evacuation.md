Evacuation Plan
===============

In the event that an emergency requiring an evacuation occurs, we
must be prepared. There are two types of evacuation: *area evacuations*,
which apply only to specific areas, and the more severe *general
evacuations* which are for the entire venue.

Area Evacuations
----------------

Should an area warden deem it appropriate, they may institute an
*area evacuation*, in which only that area is evacuated -- perhaps
into another area rather than to the evacuation point.

Discovery of Emergency
----------------------

In the case of some emergency that will require a general evacuation,
the Safety Officer and/or Head Warden must be informed as soon as
possible. They both will have radios, and area wardens can relay
information.

If, in the opinion of either the Safety Officer or Head Warden, the
building must be evacuated, they will issue an instruction to do
so over the radios.

Fires
-----

Naturally, the correct action to take in case of fire is to trigger
the fire alarm, rather than to try to radio the Head Warden or
Safety Officer.

Upon Evacuation Orders
----------------------

A general evacuation order is either:

* An instruction over the radios from the Head Warden or Safety Officer, or
* The building fire alarm.

Each of the area wardens must, as quickly as possible, evacuate
their area, via the normal fire routes. The area must be cleared
entirely of people, excepting:

* The Head Warden and Safety Officer,
* Any Blueshirts involved in dealing with the emergency directly
  (for instance, people involved in putting out fires),
* Venue security.

Blueshirts not directly involved should make their way to the
evacuation point with competitors, guests and team leaders.

For the SUSU building, the evacuation point is **TODO: yet to be found**.

Building Re-entry
-----------------

Once the Head Warden and Safety Officer agree it is safe to re-enter
the building after a general evacuation (possibly in consultation
with either Southampton Estates and Facilities or the Fire Department
in case of a fire alarm), they will ask the area wardens to return
to their posts then make an announcement at the evacuation area.

Re-entry after area evacuations are at the discretion of that area's
warden.
