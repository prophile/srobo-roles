Evacuation Plan
===============

In the event that an emergency requiring a building evacuation
occurs, we must be prepared.

Discovery of Emergency
----------------------

In the case of some emergency that will require a building evacuation,
the Safety Officer and/or Head Warden must be informed as soon as
possible. They both will have radios, and area wardens can relay
information.

If, in the opinion of either the Safety Officer or Head Warden, the
building must be evacuated, they will issue an instruction to do
so over the radios.

Upon Evacuation Orders
----------------------

Each of the area wardens must, as quickly as possible, evacuate
their area, via the normal fire routes. The area must be cleared
entirely of people, excepting:

* The Head Warden and Safety Officer,
* Any Blueshirts involved in dealing with the emergency directly
  (for instance, people involved in putting out fires),
* Venue security.

Blueshirts not directly involved should make their way to the
evacuation point with competitors, guests and team leaders.

Building Re-entry
-----------------

Once the Head Warden and Safety Officer agree it is safe to re-enter
the building, they will ask the area wardens to return to their
posts then make an announcement at the evacuation area.
