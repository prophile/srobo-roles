Radio Operating Procedure
=========================

Channel
-------

We will be using **channel 6** within the venue.

* TODO: confirm this is free

Push To Talk
------------

Broadcasting on the two-way radios is activated with a Push To Talk
(PTT) button. Accidental holding of this button for extend periods
of time will lead to your skin being removed and turned into
fashionable headwear by the head warden.

Callsigns
---------

The following callsigns will be used:

* **Head Warden** (for the head warden)
* **Safety Officer** (for the safety officer)
* **Level 2** (for the Level 2 warden)
* **Level 3** (for the Level 3 warden)
* **Concourse** (for the Concourse warden)
* **Cube** (for the Cube warden)
* **Judge** (for the Judge's desk)
* **Reception** (for the Reception desk)
* **All Stations** (for addressing everyone)

Charging
--------

Radios must be left on charge overnight. The charging station is
in the staff area.

Two spare radios are kept in the staff area.

Fire Code
---------

In order to not start a panic, a code phrase will be used to indicate
a fire in the venue. The code phrase, being subtle but on the theme
of being on fire, is "Rob's thesis".

Evacuation
----------

In the event of a general evacuation being necessary, either the
safety officer or the head warden will broadcast this over the
radios.  Radio silence must be maintained during an evacuation
unless transmission is absolutely necessary.

Interruption
------------

Except in emergencies, it is improper operating procedure to interrupt
another conversation taking place over the radios. If you have
something to add to the conversation at hand, do so by all means
once there is a break in transmission, but do not attempt to cut
across somebody to start a new conversation.

Codewords
---------

Messages must end either with the word **over**, indicating that a
response is expected, or **out** indicating that no response is
expected. The phrase **over and out** is contradictory, and will
be punished by crushing.

In the event of an emergency, the phrase **emergency, emergency,
emergency** must be used. Radio silence must be maintained until
the emergency is over, except for important messages pertaining to
the emergency.

To repeat a message, use the word **repeat** - for instance *my
hovercraft is full of eels, repeat, my hovercraft is full of eels*.
To request that another station repeat their message, use the phrase
**say again**.

Avoid the words yes and no, preferring **affirmative** and **negative**
respectively.

To confirm that you have received and understood a message, use the
word **roger**. To confirm that you have received and understood a
message, and will carry out any instructions given within it, use
the word **wilco** (*will comply*).

Prefix purely advisory messages with the phrase **be advised**.

To test that your radio is working, request a **radio check** from
all stations.  To respond to a radio check, use the phrase **loud
and clear** - assuming, of course, that is the case.

Starting a Conversation
-----------------------

Begin your conversation with the key phrase *destination*,
*destination*, **this is** *source*, *source*. *destination* may
be **all stations** to broadcast a message.

Phonetic Alphabet
-----------------

To spell out words, use the NATO phonetic alphabet.

How to Speak
------------

The three things to remember when broadcasting a message to be
*clear*, *unambiguous* and *brief*.

Think what you are going to say before pressing the transmit button,
and be sure to enunciate clearly once you do. Speak at a medium
pace, without breaking rhythm (avoid 'er' and 'um'), at an ordinary
conversation volume to avoid distortion, and at an even pitch.

If you are addressed over the radio, respond promptly. If you cannot
deal with a request at that time, say so, rather than leaving the
conversation unanswered.

Maintain professionality over the radio link. Without meaning to
sound like a kill-joy, keep the banter and jokes for in person.
