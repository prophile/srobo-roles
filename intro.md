Introduction
============

The Student Robotics competition is a complicated event to run, and
needs a fair bit of organisation and care taken to make sure it
runs smoothly and safely. It also needs a certain amount of
responsibility taken by those involved in running it.

This document details the roles and procedures involved during the
competition itself.
