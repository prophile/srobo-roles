Linesmen
========

In the interests of fairness, the judge is assisted by two *linesmen*,
present in the arena during matches, who record the proceedings of
the match.

Responsibilities
----------------

* To be present in the arena during matches,
* To record scoring information at the end of matches,
* To advise the judge on team disqualification should members of a
  team interfere with the robots or enter the arena during the match
  or the 30-second scoring period after its end,
* To remove jetsam and debris from the arena,
* To turn off robots if they present a risk to themselves, other
  robots, or spectators, assuming it is safe to do so,
* To advise the judge on the events of a match and the application
  of the rules,
* To re-set the position of the tokens between matches,
* To instruct teams when and where to put in and remove their robots,
* To extinguish fires within the arena where it is safe to do so.

Shifts
------

During match times, linesmen will be allocated in 30-minute shifts.
The shifts for the two linesmen will, unlike the battery charging
station, run concurrently.

Procedures
----------

At the beginning of a match period:

* Check the Inspection Sheet for each robot in the staging area.
* Ensure the teams have the appropriate robot badges.
* Ask the team to position their robot in the arena.

Thirty seconds before the start of a match:

* Ask any team members remaining in the arena to leave.

At the end of the match:

* Prevent competitors from entering the arena while scores are being
  taken.
* Note down the scores in the Score Sheets, if you have not already done so.
* Hand the Score Sheets to the Judge's Desk.
* Ask team members to retrieve their robots.
* Be sure to recover the badges from each outgoing robot.

In the event of a fire:

* Press a nearby Kill Switch.
* If it safe to do so, use a fire extinguisher in an attempt to put
  out the fire.
* Leave the arena and await instructions from the area warden
  otherwise.

Preparation
-----------

Blueshirts doing shifts as linesmen should familiarise themselves
with [the rules](https://www.studentrobotics.org/docs/rules), and
the usage of the powder fire extinguishers.
