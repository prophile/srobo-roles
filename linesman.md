Linesmen
========

In the interests of fairness, the judge is assisted by two *linesmen*,
present in the arena during matches, who record the proceedings of
the match.

Responsibilities
----------------

* To be present in the arena during matches,
* To record scoring information at the end of matches,
* To advise the judge on team disqualification should members of a
  team interfere with the robots or enter the arena during the match
  or the 30-second scoring period after its end,
* To remove jetsam and debris from the arena,
* To turn off robots if they present a risk to themselves, other
  robots, or spectators, assuming it is safe to do so,
* To advise the judge on the events of a match and the application
  of the rules,
* To extinguish fires within the arena where it is safe to do so.

Shifts
------

During match times, linesmen will be allocated in 30-minute shifts.
The shifts for the two linesmen will, unlike the battery charging
station, run concurrently.

Procedures

* TODO: fill in

Preparation
-----------

Blueshirts doing shifts as linesmen should familiarise themselves
with [the rules](https://www.studentrobotics.org/docs/rules), and
the usage of the powder fire extinguishers.
