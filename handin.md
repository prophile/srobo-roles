Handin
======

The handin desks are quite hectic, being that there are over 30
teams trying to return kit, and they need to be operated.

Responsibilities
----------------

* To put out the kit return desks during the awards ceremony,
* To take in kits,
* To manage the queues for the handin.

Shifts
------

There will be one person assigned to each desk for the entire handin
period.

Procedures
----------

The following procedure is used for initial set-out:

* Four Blueshirts are applied to a desk each, and one to manage the queues.
* Each desk is identified by a single colour.
* Desks should be put out near Reception.
* Each desk is equipped with the items listed in the 'Desk Items'
  subsection.

The following procedure is used for each team handing in kit:

* Ask the team for their three-letter code, and note it down on a
  fresh Handin Form, as well as the common list.
* If the team have arranged to keep their kit, put a strip of tape
  on the top of the box and skip to the last step.
* Take down the part code of the RUB on the Handin Form and the common list.
* Remove all items from the kit box. If it contains the original
  manifest, leave it in the box.
* Place any batteries in the battery collection box.
* Place items back into the box, tallying how many of each item are
  present in the Handin Form.
* Check the Handin Form for missing items.
* If any items are absent, contact Jeremy Morse who will take over
  the situation.
* If all items are present, seal the box with the electrical tape.
* Place the kit box behind the desk.
* Thank the team, invite them to the next competition, and invite
  them to next year's competition.
