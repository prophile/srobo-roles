Shepherding
===========

It falls to the *shepherds* to, during match periods, ensure that
teams are ready and waiting for their matches.

Responsibilities
----------------

* To ensure that teams and their robots are present for their matches.

Shifts
------

Shepherding will be done in 30-minute shifts during match times.

Procedures
----------

The published starting time of a match is the time at which the
actual game begins - naturally, teams have to be there before that.
Specifically, teams and robots should be at the arena **two minutes**
before their published match start time, which means shepherds must
be talking to teams **three minutes** before their published match
starting times.
