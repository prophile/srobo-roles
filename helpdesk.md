Helpdesk
========

Requests for help and information are generally funneled through *Helpdesk*,
staffed by two or more people at any one time. It is Helpdesk's job to keep
track of problems, direct competitors to Blueshirts and Blueshirts to
competitors, and to give people information where possible, or redirect them
otherwise (for instance, to the Judges).

Responsibilities
----------------

* To sit at Helpdesk,
* To provide competitors information that they request,
* To manage the Duty Techs and direct them to assist teams,
* To co-ordinate Blueshirts giving teams assistance,
* To collect discharged batteries and hand out charged batteries,
* To move discharged batteries to the battery charging station and bring back
  fresh supplies at the end of shifts,
* To direct competitors at sources of help where necessary.

Shifts
------

One Helpdesk position is a permanent position, to be delegated at
the assignee's discretion. The other position will be done in
30-minute shifts.

Helpdesk *need not be staffed during the Semifinals, Finals, and
Awards Ceremony*.

Procedures
----------

The Helpdesk tracker is available at [http://helpdesk/](http://helpdesk/).

Kit Replacement:

* Do not give kit replacements out at Helpdesk directly.
* Kit replacements, if necessary, should be sent with a Duty Tech
  to the team, so that the Duty Tech can make sure the robot is not
  going to destroy the replacement device in the same manner as its
  unfortunate predecessor.

Preparation
-----------

Blueshirts doing shifts on Helpdesk should familiarise themselves
with [the rules](https://www.studentrobotics.org/docs/rules) and,
where possible, [the docs](https://www.studentrobotics.org/docs)
-- particularly the
[troubleshooting](https://www.studentrobotics.org/docs/troubleshooting)
section. They should also familiarise themselves with the radio procedures.
