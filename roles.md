Roles
=====

Certain tasks are assigned, not to people on shifts, but *roles*.
A role will be held by one person at any one time, but that person
may change. The person holding each role at any one time will wear
a lanyard tag indicating as such. The roles are generally constrained:
the role of area warden, for instance, cannot leave its assigned
area. The person on shift as the area warden is free to do so (and
is indeed likely to need to do so at some point) as long as they
assign the role to someone else (and hand over the lanyard tag)
while they are away.

For the 2013 competition, there are six roles, all of which must
be occupied at all times during the working hours:

* Head Warden
* Safety Officer
* Level 2 Warden
* Level 3 Warden
* Cube Warden
* Concourse Warden
