DJ

It significantly improves the atmosphere at these events to have
background music, particularly when it lines up with the matches.
Therefore, during certain times of the day, we use a DJ.

* To manage the stream of music,
* To fit that stream to the circumstances at hand,

  finals,
* To, on advice from the judge, drop beats.

The DJ position runs in shifts of 1 hour, during the Sunday league
matches and the knockout.
