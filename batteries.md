Battery Charging
================

The battery charging station is the single largest fire risk at the
competition, and is thus kept at a distance from competitors. It
must be manned at all times.

Responsibilities
----------------

* To be present at the battery charging station,
* To ensure the station does not catch fire and respond appropriately
  if it does,
* To operate the chargers, and swap batteries on them.

Shifts
------

The battery charging station will be done in 30-minute shifts,
except at the end of days, where it may be shut down at the discretion
of the judge. There will be two people on the station at any one
time, with shifts overlapping by 15 minutes.

Procedures
----------

In case of a fire breaking out in the battery charging station:

* The station must *have its mains supply turned off if it is safe
  to do so*. This prevents more energy being injected into the fire.
* The alarm must be raised to evacuate the building.
* If it is safe to do so, an attempt should be made to extinguish
  the fire. Powder fire extinguishers will be supplied at the
  station. **DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE A WATER EXTINGUISHER.**

Dead or dangerous batteries should be disposed of by putting them
into the provided *Sad LiPo Bucket*, which is filled with saline.

Extra Batteries
---------------

Grey Matter Robotics have provided a large extra LiPo to supplement
the Student Robotics-provided battery. There is one charger put
aside for their extra battery.

Preparation
-----------

Blueshirts doing shifts at the battery charging station should
familiarise themselves with the [documentation on batteries and
charging](https://www.studentrobotics.org/docs/kit/batteries), as
well as the usage of fire extinguishers.
