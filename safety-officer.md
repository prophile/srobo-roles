Safety Officer
==============

The *safety officer* has responsibility for the event's safety, in
tandem with the head warden.

The safety officer must not leave the venue unless no competitors,
guests or other Blueshirts other than the assignee of the Head
Warden role are present, or they have been instructed to do so by
on-site security.

Responsibilities
----------------

* To ensure the event is run safely,
* To advise the head warden on any immediate safety concerns,
* To oversee the safety inspections before robots are permitted to compete,
* To make final decisions about what must be disallowed on safety grounds,
* To issue a general evacuation order if he or she deems it
  necessary.

Shifts
------

The role will typically be assigned to one person throughout the
event, with that individual temporarily assigning the role to others
should they need to leave the site for any reason.

Preparation
-----------

Blueshirts doing shifts of assignation as safety officer should
familiarise themselves with:

* The building's fire evacuation plan,
* The entire layout of the building, including fire alarm points,
* The radio procedures,
* The usage of powder fire extinguishers.
