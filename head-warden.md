Head Warden
===========

The *head warden* has nominal responsibility for the entire event.
The head warden must not leave the venue unless no competitors,
guests or other Blueshirts other than the assignee of the Safety
Officer role are present, or they have been instructed to do so by
on-site security.

Responsibilities
----------------

* To ensure the event is run safely, smoothly and professionally,
* To manage the Blueshirts on shifts in other roles,
* To take decisions about the appropriate response to any incidents
  that may arise and issue instructions over the radio link and --
  if necessary -- the PA system,
* To issue an general evacuation order if he or she deems it
  necessary,
* To alter the day's schedule as necessary.

Shifts
------

The role will typically be assigned to one person throughout the
event, with that individual temporarily assigning the role to others
should they need to leave the site for any reason.

Preparation
-----------

Blueshirts doing shifts of assignation as head warden should
familiarise themselves with:

* The building's fire evacuation plan,
* The entire layout of the building, including fire alarm points,
* The radio procedures,
* The usage of powder fire extinguishers,
* The Blueshirts available during the competition,
* All other tasks and roles.
