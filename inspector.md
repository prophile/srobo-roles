Inspection
==========

The *inspectors* inspect the safety of robots, and either certify
them for safety so that they can compete or fail them and give teams
guidance as to why their robots are unsafe and how to fix them.

Responsibilities
----------------

* To perform robot safety inspections,
* To *certify* that safe robots can be entered into matches,
* To *fail* any unsafe robots and advise teams on how to fix them,
* To *defer* to the Safety Officer on any robots where their safety
  status is unclear,
* To reassess any robots which were failed once a team has corrected
  the relevant issue(s).

Shifts
------

The safety officer is an inspector, and thus has a permanent shift.
Others filling the role will only usually be necessary at the
beginning of the league, and so shifts are for the entire assessment
period -- with an estimated 32 teams at the, three additional
inspectors (as well as the safety officer) are needed for a total
of 8 teams per inspector.

Procedures
----------

* TODO: fill in

Preparation
-----------

Blueshirts doing shifts as inspectors should read the safety
regulations section of [the
rules](https://www.studentrobotics.org/docs/rules) (appendix B).
